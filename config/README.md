# Config guide

Setting up the application requires the following 2 files inside the `config` directory:
* token.txt
* games.txt

## token.txt

The `token.txt` file stores the [Discord Token](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#configuring-your-bot) for your bot.  
No special formatting is needed, create the file and paste the token.

## games.txt

The `games.json` file stores the list of games available for the polls.  

Example:

```txt
Full Name of the Game
Another Game
```
